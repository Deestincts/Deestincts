- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Deestincts Hi,

Thank you for taking a minute to look at my profile.
Here is an overview of my Skills: I am goal oriented, efficient, timely, i have interest of immediate result and Iâ€™m self-motivated. Some of the many keys that has helped my progress as a Customer Service  Agent is my ability to research, learn and apply my findings to enhance my knowledge and Skills.

Iâ€™ve worked as a Customer Care Service Representative for five years  and I have firsthand one-on-one experience with all kinds of customers. These experiences are what has prepared me for virtual responsibilities and Iâ€™m keen to explore the possibilities and grow.

I have, overtime, proffered nonexistent solutions to concerns which improved Customersâ€™ experiences. Needless to say, Iâ€™m very confident in my problem solving skills.

One of my top goals is to make â€˜Top Virtual Assistanceâ€™ list sooner.

It is of genuine interest that Iâ€™ve chosen to make a great career out of Customer Care Services.

I look forward to exceeding the expectations of my employer and the customers and I will. Itâ€™s a daily affirmation that I carry with me in this journey.
